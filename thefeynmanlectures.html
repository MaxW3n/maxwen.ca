<h1>The Feynman Lectures on PhysicsðŸ““</h1>

<p>Inspired by my brother <a href="https://github.com/Sigil-Wen/feynman-lectures"> Sigil Wen</a>, I have decided to also share and document my reading of the Feynman Lectures.<br>Although I got the book before Sigil, I ded not delegate as much time into reading it and put it down.<br>Now, I want to dedicate the next year to understanding the Feynman Lectures</p>

        ~June 2023: Sigil has just bought me the Feynman Lectures of Physics

    <li>~Mid August 2023: I finished reading and annotating chapter 1
        <ul>
            2 new terms:
            <li>Brownian Motion: The motion of particles caused by the bombardment of atoms</li>
            <li>Dispersion: The accidental accumulation of energy built up from the movement of atoms, causing atoms to break off(evaporation)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
